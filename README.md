# 🚀 Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 - Distance Measurement with LEDs

## 🎯 Overview
This project uses an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure distance and visually indicate the range using **LEDs**. The sensor calculates the distance by sending ultrasonic pulses and measuring the time it takes for them to return. Different LEDs turn on depending on how close an object is to the sensor.

## 📝 Code Explanation
### 1️⃣ Pin Initialization
- The **HC-SR04** sensor uses two pins:
  - `trig` (Trigger) - Sends an ultrasonic pulse
  - `echo` (Echo) - Receives the reflected pulse
- Five **LEDs** are connected to digital pins.

### 2️⃣ Distance Calculation
- The **trigger pin** is set HIGH for **1000µs** to send an ultrasonic pulse.
- The **pulse duration** is measured using `pulseIn(echo, HIGH)`.
- Distance is calculated using the formula:
  ```cpp
  distance = (duration / 2) / 28.5;
  ```
  - The divisor **28.5** converts the time into centimeters.

### 3️⃣ LED Activation Based on Distance
- The LEDs turn on based on distance thresholds:
  - **≤10 cm** → LED 1 ON
  - **≤20 cm** → LED 2 ON
  - **≤30 cm** → LED 3 ON
  - **≤40 cm** → LED 4 ON
  - **≤50 cm** → LED 5 ON
- LEDs turn OFF if the distance is greater than the respective threshold.
