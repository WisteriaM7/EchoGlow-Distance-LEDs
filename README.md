🚀 Arduino Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with LEDs
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is widely used for measuring distances. It consists of an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver, which emit high-frequency sound waves and detect the reflected signal when an object is present. This project visually represents distance using LED indicators.

📌 Features
✅ Measures distances from 2cm to 400cm 📏
✅ Operates on +5V DC 🔋
✅ Measuring angle: 30° 🔄
✅ Used for obstacle detection, water level measurement, and distance sensing 🏗️🚗🌊

🛠 Requirements
🔹 Arduino Uno 🖥️
🔹 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 🎯
🔹 5-7 LEDs 💡
🔹 220Ω resistors (one per LED) 🛑
🔹 Breadboard ⚡
🔹 Jumper Wires 🔗

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ The HC-SR04 sensor sends an ultrasonic pulse.
2️⃣ The pulse bounces off an object and returns to the sensor.
3️⃣ The Arduino calculates the distance based on the time taken.
4️⃣ LEDs light up progressively based on the detected distance.

🎨 Applications
🔹 Obstacle Avoidance Systems 🚗
🔹 Smart Parking Assist 🅿️
🔹 Water Level Monitoring 💧
🔹 Proximity Sensors for Robots 🤖
