# EchoGlow-Distance-LEDs
This Arduino project uses the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distance and visually represent it using LEDs. The closer an object is, the more LEDs light up, providing a real-time distance indicator. This is great for obstacle detection, parking assist systems, or fun DIY projects!
